# Unemployment Analysis Using Python

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of unemployment data using Python. The goal of this project is to leverage various Python libraries and data analysis techniques to gain insights into unemployment trends, factors, and patterns. The analysis provides valuable information that can help policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders better understand the dynamics of unemployment.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing: Gather unemployment data from reliable sources and clean it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize unemployment trends over time, by region, and demographic factors.
- Statistical analysis: Perform statistical tests to identify significant differences in unemployment rates.
- Data visualization: Create informative and visually appealing charts and graphs to communicate findings effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the analysis step by step.
4. Customize the analysis for your own data or region by modifying the code and data sources.
